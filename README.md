# ML-Contests-Infrared-spectrum-classification
Classify solid samples according to their diffuse reflectance infrared spectra

The Near Infrared Spectroscopy Branch of the China Instrument Society holds the data modeling contest. The organizer provides a set of near-infrared spectral data from the actual application scenario.

Different data preprocessing technologies (e.g. PCA, normalization) and machine learning models (AutoML) were tried for the classification problem. ExtraTreesClassifier was used as the final model. Our work won an excellent award in this competition.
